# Unit Test with JUnit and Mockito
## What makes a good Unit test:
1) Readable: within 10-15 seconds, you know what the code is testing.
2) Fast: you would want to run your test every hour, or 2 times per day minimum
3) Isolated: failure only at code, not external factors
4) Run often: to catch bug as early as possible
